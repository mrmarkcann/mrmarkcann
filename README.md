# Hi there, I'm Mark 👋

![Mark's GitHub Banner](https://github.com/mrmarkcann/mrmarkcann/raw/master/github_banner.png "Github banner")

I'm an IT professional with about 20 years experience in IT operations and engineering, I've more recently been dabbling with the software side of things and trying to snaffle as much learning as I can about things.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning PowerShell, Python, Terraform, Microsoft Azure and Dot Net amongst other things, probably.
